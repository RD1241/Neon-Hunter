# 🎯 Neon Hunter

![Neon Hunter Gameplay](./image.png)

**Neon Hunter** is a fast-paced neon survival game built using **HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript**.  
Your goal is simple: **survive as long as you can**.

As time progresses, enemies become faster, smarter, and more aggressive — testing your reflexes, movement, and decision-making skills.
